The  database contains the raw range-azimuth measurements obtained from mmWave MIMO radars (IWR1843BOOST http://www.ti.com/tool/IWR1843BOOST) deployed in different positions around a robotic manipulator.

Instructions:

The database contains 5 data structures:

i) mmwave_data_test has dimension 900 x 256 x 63. Contains 900 FFT range-azimuth measurements of size 256 x 63: 256-point range samples corresponding to a max range of 11m (min range of 0.5m) and 63 angle bins, corresponding to DOA ranging from -75 to +75 degree. These data are used for testing (validation database). The corresponding labels are in label_test. Each label (from 0 to 5) corresponds to one of the 6 positions (from 1 to 6) of the operator as detailed in the image attached.



ii) mmwave_data_train has dimension 900 x 256 x 63. Contains 900 FFT range-azimuth measurements used for training. The corresponding labels are in label_train.



iii) LABELS AND CLASSES: label_test with dimension 900 x 1, contains the true labels for test data (mmwave_data_test). These are the (true) classes corresponding to integer labels from 0 to 5. Each class corresponds to a subject position in the surrounding of the robot, in particular:

CLASS (or LABEL) 0 identifies the human operator as working close-by the robot, at distance between 0.5 and 0.7 m and azimtuh 40-60 deg (positive).

CLASS 1 identifies the human operator as working close-by the robot, at distance between 0.3 and 0.5 m and azimtuh in the range -10 + 10 deg.

CLASS 2 identifies the human operator as working close-by the robot, at distance between 0.5 and 0.7 m and azimtuh 40-60 deg (negative).

CLASS 3 identifies the human operator as working at distance between 1 and 1.2 m from the robot and azimtuh 20-40 deg (negative).

CLASS 4 identifies the human operator as working close-by the robot, at distance between 0.9 and 1.1 m and azimtuh in the range -10 + 10 deg.

CLASS 5 identifies the human operator as working at distance between 1 and 1.2 m from the robot and azimtuh 20-40 deg (positive).


iv) label_train with dimension 900 x 1, contains the true labels for train data (mmwave_data_train), namely classes (true labels) correspond to integers from 0 to 5.


v) p (1 x 900) contains the chosen random permutation for data partition among nodes/device and federated learnig simulation (see python code).
