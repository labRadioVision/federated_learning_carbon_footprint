# Federated Learning implementations
The code and data examples are used for testing different FL designs and instrumental to carbon and energy footprint assessment. For further information see
https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.10346

Include example on MNIST dataset (folder MNIST dataset), a custom radar dataset and (folder FL radar dataset) and a Federated Reinforcement Learning implementation based on deep Q learning (DQL) method (folder ReinforcementLearning). Please check the readmefiles for further information.
