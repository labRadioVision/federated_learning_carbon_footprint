# Federated Learning implementations
The code and data examples are used for testing different FL designs instrumental to carbon and energy footprint assessment. For further information see
https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.10346

Include example on MNIST dataset (folder MNIST dataset), a custom radar dataset and (folder FL radar dataset, see https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.03367) and a Federated Reinforcement Learning implementation based on deep Q-learning (DQL) method (see the folder ReinforcementLearning). 
Please check the readme files for further information.
